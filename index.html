In this project,  we study the first-principles approach of quantum chemistry through symbolic computation.

In [KIKUCHI2013], Akihito Kikuchi presented an example of the first-principles approach of quantum chemistry, wherein a contemporary technique of computational algebraic geometry is adopted. The author of that article prepared the analytic energy functional of one hydrogen molecule. He approximated it by a polynomial, and, through symbolic differentiation, he composed a set of polynomial equations which gives the minima of the energy functional.  Finally, he was successful in solving it using the Gr\"obner basis technique. To construct one- or two-electron integrals, he used the Slater-Type Orbitals (STO) for atomic orbitals.

However, the STO  is not the standard way of today's quantum chemistry, for it is an unsettled problem how to construct analytical representations of two-electron integrals in poly-atomic systems using STO.  Currently, as an alternative, most researchers use Gaussian-Type-Orbitals (GTO) because of the easiness of GTO in symbolic manipulation.

For this reason, we choose GTO as the basic ingredient of the research. We prepare the electron integrals using GTO, and according to the fundamental scheme of [KIKUCHI2013], we derive the polynomial equations to unravel the quantum states. We solve them through computational algebra packages, such as Singular, using symbolic-numeric computations.

In this repository, we put our computer programs which enable us to pursue the following targets.

(1) The analytical computation of atomic-orbital integrals by GTO

(2) The algebraic method to solve polynomial equations by the Groebner basis technique

(3) EXAMPLES of Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) or Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) computations.


The progrmams are written in Python, with the intensive usage of sympy library.
